// This is a Next.js page component that renders a main element with a heading.
// The heading has a class that applies Tailwind CSS styles to make it large, bold, and underlined.
// The component is exported as the default export of the module, which allows Next.js to use it as a page.
// The function is named Home, which is a common convention for the main page of a Next.js application.
// The component returns a JSX element that represents the structure of the page.
